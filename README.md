🚀 Check Out My Public Repository! 🚀

I’m excited to share my public repository, which features a collection of examples of functional programming and data structures and algorithms (DSA) implemented in JavaScript and PHP! 💻

This repository is organized into two folders, each packed with various coding challenges. I’ve focused on creating custom solutions in my unique coding style, avoiding the use of built-in functions. 📂✨

🔍 Here’s what you’ll find inside:
- A variety of core DSA concepts tackled from scratch 🧠
- Manual implementations to enhance algorithmic thinking 💡
- Solutions written in JavaScript and PHP for a diverse experience ⚙️
- Clean, well-documented code for easy understanding and collaboration 📝

💥 Whether you're a developer, a problem solver, or someone passionate about functional programming and coding challenges, there’s something here for you! Although the repository is relatively small for now, I plan to expand it soon with more challenges, optimizations, and new ideas. 🚀

Feel free to explore, contribute, and connect! Let’s grow together as we dive deep into algorithm design and software development. 🌍

🌟 Stay tuned for more! I’ll soon be launching a new repository where I’ll explore the Laravel 11 ecosystem and its rich features. 🔥
