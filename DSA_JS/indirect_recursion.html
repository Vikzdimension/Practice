    <h1>Indirect Recursion</h1>
    <p>Indirect Recursion is a type of recursion in which there are two or more functions and they call each other in a circular manner. In this type of recursion, the functions call each other in a circular manner. The function calls itself and then calls the other function and this process goes on.</p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Let's take an example of two functions BuyBanana and BuyMore. Function BuyBanana calls function BuyMore and function BuyMore calls function BuyBanana. This is an example of indirect recursion.</p>
    <input type="button" value="Buy Banana With All Money" onclick="BuyBanana()">
    <p>Number of bananas: <span id="bananas">0</span></p>
    <p>Money: <span id="money">100</span></p>

<script>
    let bananas = 0;
    let money = 100;

    function updateDisplay(){
        document.getElementById("bananas").innerHTML = bananas;
        document.getElementById("money").innerHTML = money;
    }
    function BuyBanana(){
        if(money >= 10){
            BuyMore();
        }
        else{
            console.log("You don't have enough money to buy a banana");
            alert("You don't have enough money to buy a banana");
        }   
    }

    function BuyMore(){
            console.log("You have bought a banana");
            alert(`You have bought ${bananas} bananas`);
            bananas++;
            money -= 10;
            updateDisplay();
            BuyBanana();
    }
    updateDisplay();
</script>
